## 2. Why can't I log in?

Please check if `NUXT_SITE_TOKEN` is set to pure numbers, Sink does not support pure number Tokens, we consider this to be unsafe.

## 3. Why can't I see the analytics data?

Analytics data requires access to Cloudflare’s settings:

1. Verify `NUXT_CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `NUXT_CF_API_TOKEN` are configured correctly (ensure the Account ID matches the deployment zone ID).
2. Check that the Worker analytics engine is enabled.

## 4. I don't want the current homepage? Can it be redirected to my blog?

Of course. Please set the environment variable `NUXT_HOME_URL` to your blog or official website address.

## 5. Why can't I see statistics after deploying with NuxtHub?

NuxtHub's ANALYTICS points to its dataset, you need to set the `NUXT_DATASET` environment variable to point to the same dataset.

## 6. Why are links always case-insensitive?

This is a feature of Sink. By default, we automatically convert all links to lowercase to avoid case-sensitive issues and improve usability. This ensures users don’t encounter errors due to accidental capitalization differences.

However, you can disable this feature by setting the `NUXT_CASE_SENSITIVE` environment variable to `true`.

### What happens when `NUXT_CASE_SENSITIVE` is `true`?

Newly generated links will be case-sensitive, treating `MyLink` and `mylink` as distinct. Randomly generated slugs will include both uppercase and lowercase characters, offering a larger pool of unique combinations (but not user-friendly that why we default to non-case-sensitive).
